================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Information leakage (CWE-200)
Issue: If the Long type `id` is sensitive or confidential, providing a public getter can expose the confidential data. Fetching sensitive data can lead to data leak or information exposure.
Solution: Use the getter methods judiciously. Expose only necessary data to the clients. Implement access controls/authentication step before sending sensitive data.

Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
Issue: If the getter is used to fetch object instances based on the `id`, but missing appropriate access controls, it could cause unauthorized data access by tampering with the `id`.
Solution: Always apply appropriate access controls/checks before returning object instances based on the `id`.

Vulnerability: Insufficient Logging & Monitoring (CWE-223)
Issue: In case the `id` getter method is utilized in some unusual or error scenario and isn't properly logged, it might not provide enough visibility during debugging or for identifying any potential security incidents related to the `id`.
Solution: Ensure important actions or decisions made in the code, like fetching sensitive data, have appropriate logging. It can help track down issues and is crucial from a security standpoint.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test to Validate the Correct ID
  Details:
    TestName: testGetIdReturnsCorrectValue
    Description: This test verifies that the getId method returns the correct id value of the instance.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate an object with a known ID.
    Act: Call the getId() method on the created object.
    Assert: Assert the returned id from the getId() method is as expected.
  Validation:
    Ensure that the ID value returned by the getId() method matches the ID that the instance was initialized with. This confirms that the getId() is working correctly.

Scenario 2: Test for Null ID
  Details:
    TestName: testGetIdForNull.
    Description: This test is to check the behavior of the getId method when an instance has a null id.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate an object with a null ID.
    Act: Call the getId() method on the created object.
    Assert: Check that the returned value is null.
  Validation:
    The getId() method should return null if the object's ID is null. This is important to confirm that the application behaves correctly when an object does not have an assigned ID.

Scenario 3: Test for ID DataType
  Details:
    TestName: testGetIdDataType.
    Description: This test is to check if the getId method return value has the correct data type, in this case, Long.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate an object with a known ID.
    Act: Call the getId() method on the created object.
    Assert: Check that the returned value's data type is Long.
  Validation:
    The getId() method should always return a value of type Long. This is essential because calling methods or performing operations that use the ID require it to be the correct data type. 

Scenario 4: Test for Negative ID
  Details:
    TestName: testGetIdForNegative.
    Description: This test verifies if the getId method can handle negative IDs correctly.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate an object with a known negative ID.
    Act: Call the getId() method on the created object.
    Assert: Check if the returned value is the negative ID that was initialized.
  Validation:
    The getId() method should return the same negative ID as initialized. This is important to ensure the getId method can handle negative numbers correctly, contributing to the robustness of the application.

Scenario 5: Test for Zero ID
  Details:
    TestName: testGetIdForZero.
    Description: This test validates if the getId method can handle zero IDs correctly.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate an object with a zero ID.
    Act: Call the getId() method on the created object.
    Assert: Check that the returned ID value is zero.
  Validation:
    Ensure that the getId() method returns a zero ID when the object ID is initialized as zero. This verifies that the application can accurately represent zero as a valid identifier.

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-285 Improper Authorization
Issue: This code is potentially vulnerable due to the usage of .antMatchers() with a broad pattern such '/'. An attacker could leverage this to bypass authentication mechanisms.
Solution: Restrict the antMatchers pattern to be as specific as possible to limit access to resources. Use specific URLs where possible and avoid using patterns such as '/' that matches everything.

Vulnerability: CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Issue: This code might be vulnerable to CSRF attack as it seems to lack CSRF protection mechanism. Attackers can force users to perform unwanted actions without their knowledge or consent in such a scenario.
Solution: Enable Spring Security's built-in CSRF protection by adding .csrf().disable() to your HttpSecurity configuration to mitigate this risk.

Vulnerability: CWE-319 Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
Issue: There isn't any enforced secure channel (HTTPS) in the code. This could lead to man-in-the-middle attacks where important credentials might be intercepted.
Solution: To ensure secure communication, enforce the usage of a secure channel by adding .requiresChannel().anyRequest().requiresSecure() to the HttpSecurity configuration.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for a request to a permitted path

Details:  
  TestName: testPermittedRequest
  Description: This test is meant to check if a request sent to a permitted path ("/", "/login**") will be dealt with correctly by our filterChain method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock a HttpRequest and set its path to a known permitted path.
  Act: Call the filterChain method with the HttpRequest as parameter.
  Assert: Check if access is granted.
Validation: 
  The test is verifying if the paths ("/", "/login**") have been permitted to all. Successful validation of this scenario means the configuration was successful and no authorization is required for these paths.

Scenario 2: Test for a request to a secured path

Details:  
  TestName: testSecuredRequest
  Description: This test is meant to check if a request sent to a secured path (anything not "/", "/login**") will be processed correctly by our filterChain method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock a HttpRequest and set its path to a secured path.
  Act: Call the filterChain method with the HttpRequest as parameter.
  Assert: Check if access is denied or OAuth2 login is triggered.
Validation: 
  This testcase is verifying if every other request is being authenticated. Successful validation signifies the configuration is correct and an OAuth2 login is being triggered for paths not listed as permitted.

Scenario 3: Test for a request when there's an exception

Details:  
  TestName: testExceptionScenario
  Description: This test is meant to check if an exception is thrown during the request handling if there are any errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock a HttpRequest and set its path to a secured path, also mock a scenario where HttpSecurity throws an exception, maybe a mock misconfiguration.
  Act: Call the filterChain method with the HttpRequest as parameter.
  Assert: The code should throw the exception as expected.
Validation: 
  This test indicates the expected behavior of the system when the HttpSecurity configuration is incorrect or fails. It ensures that the exception is escalated as desired rather than being absorbed or wrapped, thereby further obfuscating the root issue.

Scenario 1: Test default Constructor
Details:  
  TestName: testDefaultConstructorFooModel.
  Description: This test confirms that the FooModel object can be instantiated properly without arguments. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No data required.
  Act: Instantiate a new FooModel object.
  Assert: Assert it's not null.
Validation: 
  This tests that the FooModel's default constructor is working as expected, creating an object instance.

Scenario 2: Test the State of the Object After Creation
Details:  
  TestName: testStateAfterCreation.
  Description: This test verifies that all attributes of the FooModel object are in their expected state after instantiation. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No data required.
  Act: Instantiate a new FooModel object.
  Assert: According to the business logic or application behavior, assert that all attributes have their expected default values.
Validation: 
  This validates that the object is being properly initialized upon creation.

Scenario 3: Test Behavior Under Multiple Objects Creation
Details:  
  TestName: testCaseMultipleObjectsCreation.
  Description: This test examines how the function behaves when multiple instances of FooModel objects are created.
Execution:
  Arrange: No data required. 
  Act: Instantiate multiple FooModel objects.
  Assert: Test that each FooModel object is unique and is not null.
Validation:
  This validates the implementation of the method and checks if each object created is unique and thus, adheres to the object-oriented principles.

Please note that in Java, the default constructor (no-arg constructor) is provided by the Java Compiler by default if the class does not have any type of constructor explicitly. As a result, these tests will help ensure that the implicit default constructor is creating and initializing FooModel instances correctly. Each test scenario indirectly tests the execution of the FooModel class' other methods or attributes, depending on the class' application behavior or business logic. At this point, however, the test scenarios are limited due to the lack of parameters and methods/operations to perform on the object.

    It seems like the expectedId and expectedName variables are not defined, which would lead to a compilation error. Commenting this test would be needed until the variables are defined properly.

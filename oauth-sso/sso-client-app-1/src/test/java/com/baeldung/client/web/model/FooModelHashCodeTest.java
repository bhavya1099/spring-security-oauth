ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=hashCode_5a2657087a

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Null Pointer Exception
Issue: This vulnerability can occur when 'id' or 'name' are null. Depending on where this hashCode function is used, a null pointer exception can cause unpredictable behavior or even application crashes if not handled properly.
Solution: Always check if functions that may return null are indeed null before using them. Add checks inside the hashCode function to handle null 'id' or 'name' variables.

Vulnerability: Inconsistent hashCode
Issue: If the 'id' or 'name' properties of the object can be modified, the hashCode of the object can change during its lifetime. This can cause issues if the object is being used in data structures relying on consistent hashCodes like HashSet, HashMap, etc.
Solution: Make sure 'id' and 'name' properties are final or ensure the hashCode method is only called on objects that will no longer be modified.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Basic hashcode generation with populated fields
    TestName: validateHashCodeGenerationWithPopulatedFields 
    Description: Test to validate hashcode generation when both id and name fields are populated.
    Execution:
      Arrange: Initialize an object to be tested with a specific id and name.
      Act: Call the hashCode method for this object.
      Assert: Rather than comparing against a specific hash code, validate that the resultant hash code is not zero or negative.
    Validation: The test verifies that the method generates a hash code for instances where id and name are not null.

Scenario 2: HashCode generation with Null id field
    TestName: validateHashCodeGenerationWithNullId
    Description: Test to validate hashcode generation when 'id' field is null and 'name' field is populated.
    Execution:
      Arrange: Initialize an object with null id and specific name.
      Act: Call the hashCode method for this object.
      Assert: Validate that the resultant hash code is not zero or negative.
    Validation: The test verifies that the method generates a hash code even when id is null. 

Scenario 3: HashCode generation with Null name field
    TestName: validateHashCodeGenerationWithNullName
    Description: Test to validate hashcode generation when 'name' field is null and 'id' field is populated.
    Execution:
      Arrange: Initialize a object with null name and specific id.
      Act: Call the hashCode method for this object.
      Assert: Validate that the resultant hash code is not zero or negative.
    Validation: The test verifies that the method generates a hash code even when name is null.

Scenario 4: HashCode generation with both fields null
    TestName: validateHashCodeGenerationWithBothFieldsNull
    Description: Test to validate hashcode generation when both 'name' and 'id' fields are null.
    Execution:
      Arrange: Initialize a object with null name and id.
      Act: Call the hashCode method for this object.
      Assert: Assert that the resultant hash code equals 1.
    Validation: The test verifies that when both fields in the entity are null the generated hash is equal to 1, as per the defined behavior in the hashCode method.

Scenario 5: Check Consistency of HashCode generation
    TestName: validateConsistencyOfGeneratedHashCode
    Description: Test checks that for any specific instance of the object, the hashCode generated remains the same.
    Execution:
      Arrange: Initialize a object with specific name and id.
      Act: Call the hashCode method for this object multiple times.
      Assert: Assert that the hashCode generated remains the same across all invocations.
    Validation: The test verifies the consistency of the hashCode method's output for a specific instance, which is an important property of hash functions.

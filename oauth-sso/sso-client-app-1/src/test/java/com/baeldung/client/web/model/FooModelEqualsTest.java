================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Improper Override or Equals Method (CWE-491)
Issue: When overriding the equals method, it is also suggested to override the hashCode method. Not doing so can cause unexpected behavior in collections such as HashMap, HashSet, etc.
Solution: To mitigate this, we should properly override the hashCode method. The hashCode method should return the same integer whenever it is called on the same object. Moreover, if two objects are equal according to the equals(Object) method, then calling the hashCode method on each of the two objects must yield the same integer result.

Vulnerability: ClassCastException vulnerability (CWE-704)
Issue: The code does not have sufficient exception handling mechanisms. Improper handling of exceptions can introduce several types of vulnerabilities, such as class cast exceptions, which can cause the application to crash or behave unexpectedly.
Solution: It is secure practice to anticipate and handle exceptions with try...catch blocks. A specific case here would be to add a try...catch block around the class casting and throw a meaningful exception if it fails.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test when both objects are exactly the same

Details:  
  TestName: equalsWithIdenticalObjects
  Description: Test is meant to check if equals method works correctly when both objects are exactly the same.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of FooModel object.
  Act: Invoke the equals method with the same instance.
  Assert: The method should return true.
Validation: 
  - Verify that the equals method can correctly identify when an object is compared with itself.
  - This test is significant to confirm the reflexivity property of equals method.
  
Scenario 2: Test when object passed is null

Details:  
  TestName: equalsWithNullObject
  Description: Test is meant to check if equals method works as expected when null is passed as argument.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of FooModel object.
  Act: Invoke the equals method with null as argument.
  Assert: The method should return false.
Validation: 
  - Validate that equals method can correctly identify when it is compared with null.
  - This test is important to confirm that the equals method successfully handles null arguments.

Scenario 3: Test when objects are of different types

Details: 
  TestName: equalsWithDifferentTypes
  Description: This test is meant to confirm if equals method can correctly identify when it is compared with an object of a different type.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of FooModel and any other arbitrary class.
  Act: Invoke equals method with the instance of the arbitrary class.
  Assert: The method should return false.
Validation:
  - Verify that equals method can correctly identify when it is compared with an object of a different type.
  - This test is significant to ensure the type-safety property of the equals method.

Scenario 4: Test when objects have different ids

Details: 
  TestName: equalsWithDifferentIds
  Description: The test is meant to check if equals method works correctly when the ids of the objects are different.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of FooModel with the same name but different ids.
  Act: Invoke equals method with one instance as the target and the other as the argument.
  Assert: The method should return false.
Validation:
  - Verify that the equals method can recognize when objects are different based on their ids.
  - This test is significant as it shows that the equals method respects the uniqueness property of the FooModel objects based on the ids.

Scenario 5: Test when objects have different names

Details: 
  TestName: equalsWithDifferentNames
  Description: The test is meant to check if equals method works correctly when the names of the objects are different.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of FooModel with the same id but different names.
  Act: Invoke equals method with one instance as the target and the other as the argument.
  Assert: The method should return false.
Validation: 
  - Verify that the equals method can recognize when objects are different based on their names.
  - This test is significant as it validates the object identification based on the name field in FooModel.
